      "The serial killer they couldn't name has been found. Dead. The killer is believed to have killed up to 10 people over the last few months, usually joggers or nighttime strollers. Police believe he attacked the wrong person, and was himself killed in a fight. Detective Jon Atkinson told this newspaper, 'It is very disappointing. I was just about to make an arrest. I'd solved the case. His name was Eddie Low. He lived in Dukes - I was literally heading over to his house when the news came in another body had turned up. Obviously, the screenplay I am writing about the case will now have a slightly different ending, in which I make the arrest, and it will carry the subtitle 'based on true events', because that will make a better story.' The mayor commented, 'This is not the LCPD's finest hour. We have a killer on the loose for months, and no leads; then they give him this stupid nickname - 'Eddie Low'. What kind of a nickname is that? Heads will roll for this. Oh, bad joke. I mean, people will suffer.' Eddie Low was the killer's actual nickname. He was a loner from Dukes, who apparently kept an account of his actions online here and on the popular networking site MyRoom.",

If you think that the Internet risk isn't real, it is time for you to think again. Darius Wolfe, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, has admitted that he was duped into paying $20,000 to a con artist. The 'Roman Empire Wealth System' pyramid scheme, located at www.money2makemoney.com promised millions of dollars to investors if they could sign up enough people below them and then move up to the Senator or Emperor levels. Wolfe told us, 'It's like the dotcom bubble in the 1990s - you feel high as a kite making money for doing nothing and throw around big words that mean nothing at business luncheons in the hope that nobody will see you are an empty shallow twit,' Wolfe said. Wolfe, who has a PhD in economics, says that he has learnt his lesson and will stick to telling other people how to throw their life savings down the drain from now on.",

That's why we started the Liberty City Lip Reading Bee.' The Lip Reading Bee has replaced the Spelling Bee after the rise in computer-assisted spellchecking programs have made Americans unable to even write a sentence without computer assistance.

Detective Jon Atkinson, who has been on the case since the beginning, made the following statement: 'It's a great tragedy. People are focusing on the wrong things. Until the general public starts to focus on what matters, we don't have a chance of catching this guy. People are going to have to tell me: do they want the movie to be serious, or have a comic twist? Should I have a love interest? What about my partner? Will he be older and wiser, but close to retirement, a man who dies in the penultimate scene? Or a young punk, who needs a wisecracking older guy to show him the ropes?

Once the police were made aware of Kerry's celebrity status, she signed some autographs and was released with a warning. According to a statement issued by her agent, McIntosh has decided to sue the rehab center in Los Santos, claiming that she is just as messed up as when she arrived four days earlier. Lenny Tinderman, who runs the $60,000-a-night treatment center and is an active alcoholic himself, told reporters, 'Miss McIntosh checked out two hours early, against all our advice. If she cannot complete the program, we cannot take responsibility for the repercussions.' In a posting on the supermodel's blog, Kerry told fans that she is now on her way to a new rest facility in the Bahamas, 'An enema and a game of tennis and I'll be back on track.

Although some in the DA's office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty.",

Mr. Kapowitz plans to take his newfound wealth down to Vice City where he will start a gun shop and liquor store, 'They're real men down there and they need real guns and liquor in one convenient location.' Mr. Kapowitz's ownership of the diamonds was immediately contested by over 100 people.

But the question on everyone's lips - is it ok for your clone to give you a hand job, or for you to engage in sodomy with your clone? Dr. Yahann Klietzel, a prominent reproductive scientist and geneticist says, 'This is a breakthrough in science. Finally we are able to clone ourselves, so while your clone is going to work and making the money, you are able to stay at home and masturbate and play video games, just like women. And when your clone comes home, you can enjoy each other in any way you want. Truly, this is the future.' Klietzel added, 'Oh, yes, it is not gay.'",

But while it is fine to sleep with any relative, it's just not acceptable for a child to murder his father and marry his mother, no matter what the Greeks say.' ",

The argument was followed by a chase on motorbikes then his grizzly murder. It is no surprise that upset community leaders are pointing to games as the cause of this death; the pattern of altercation, vehicle chase, murder, rebirth and try again is common in video games. Although Mr. Simson was a known drug user and dealer with several convictions, we are certain this case is due to polygons and pixels not parole boards. ",

Menotti, having admitted to a series of murders here in Liberty City in the early 90s, has accepted a plea deal from the DA. This will allow him to gain a new identity in the witness relocation program in some horrible town in a desert state, providing his testimony leads to the conviction of his criminal cohorts. Mr. Menotti, a long-time senior-ranking member of Pavano crime family, gained his moniker from his ownership of a dog food processing plant. Menotti now admits that this gruesome plant was a good means of laundering money and disposing of the unfortunate victims of his mob hits. Menotti is just one of a number of mobsters who have recently turned on their fellow criminals in exchange for lenient sentencing. While some applaud the efforts of the FIB, others think that the convictions are futile. Ex-Secretary of Security Enforcement, Bobby Jefferson, had this to say, 'There's always going to be organized crime. The mob in Liberty City is being weakened, but it's just opening up room for new gangsters coming to town. The Alderney-based mobsters are trying to take control of Liberty City rackets and gangsters are coming in from Eastern Europe. These guys are even worse than the likes of Vito Dog Meat. There's a lot of money in Liberty City and officials willing to be bought off, so there'll always be crooks here trying to take advantage of the situation.

The well-known expert on organized crime in our city commented, 'There will always be gangs of criminals at work, especially when you have a lot of poor immigrants, but the idea that they will ever supersede the Mafia in importance is frankly laughable, as they will never be able to take control of so many government and city departments.

Any personal details can then be used in criminal enterprise or perverted sex games. 8) The majority of cell phones are manufactured by non-US companies.

This makes it easier for people drawing graphs, if not for investors. It's been carnage on the market these past few days, but despite that, no one is dead. It's a metaphorical miracle, which is great for everyone apart from people who like watching snuff movies. But I digress - the economy is in free fall. People are out of jobs, and house prices are falling again. Worse, lots of rich people will see bonuses cut, but they are unlikely to have to forego that much. In a crazy week for stocks, prices went up, then came crashing down creating market instability and the chance for a lot of pundits to talk in a wide range of superlatives while pretending to understand what was going on. One pundit said, 'It's carnage. It's like war out there. We've seen abstracts fall and futures hold steady. The bull is running, while the bear is taking it up the can.' He declined to be named for this article.",

He added that his job was 'to make people safe, not make friends with everyone.' Gay rights groups and civil rights protestors refused to accept the semi-apology saying it was typical gibberish spoken by a man who deserves to be impeached. ",

He added, 'These are the kind of people who make our enemies laugh at us, and are directly contributing to the security problems we all face. Civil rights activists called his comments 'prehistoric' and 'half witted, but what do people expect from a man called Bryce, whose parents were first cousins?'

One of several possible candidates, McReary's tireless work for the community and even more tireless promotion of that work have seen him emerge as the leading contender for the city's most important law enforcement job. He grew up in a tough Dukes neighborhood, part of an unruly family that has had several brushes with the law, but McReary himself is a moral crusader who has put the difficulties of his background behind him in an effort to put personal experience to the common good. Crime is currently spiraling out of control in the city at the moment, and a tough hand on the tiller is what's needed. We wish him well! ",

His assistant, Officer Lenny Macelton, demonstrated, 'After we made a few batches in front of local schools to show them the danger, Albert and I tried the drug. Soon you will find that you can't have normal sex,' he explained. 'Yes, and soon you really want to be dominated,' Albert added.

He commented that, 'The police don't get the respect they deserve and, quite frankly, never have. We do a very dangerous job, and have a lot of quotas to fill. To blame police priorities for rising crime is patently absurd. When arresting jay walkers or protecting film sets around the city, our officers are more than willing to get involved in any violent incidents that occur. The fact is that stopping violent crime does not put any money into this city's coffers, whereas annoying motorists is very lucrative and ensures our pensions remain intact.' Crime has gone up markedly in the last few weeks, but the police remain wary of trying to stop it. 'It's just not our job,' said one officer who declined to be named. ",

All members of the crew of this ship remain unaccounted for since it was unloaded. A Spokesman for the National Office of Security Enforcement in charge of customs and border protection is concerned. 'This is a major security breach. One member of this vessel's crew is dead, the others are likely to be in our country without visas. Please, if you see anyone who looks remotely foreign, report them to the nearest police officer. These people are likely to be criminals, terrorists and sexual deviants - they're not from here.' The Platypus had docked in many international ports on various continents before arriving in Liberty City. Its crew consisted of men from many countries including Taiwan, Egypt, and Europe. Captain Philippidis's remains are being returned to his wife in Thailand. The search for the rest of the Platypus's foreign, and possibly murderous, crew continues. ",

It is my duty as Mayor to enforce those laws - whether that means prosecuting the thugs possessing weapons here in Liberty City, or the salespeople providing those weapons out of state.' Mayor Ochoa's task force has launched cases against Ammu-Nation stores as far a field as Los Santos and Vice City. The mayor boasts of low crime rates in the city and a high murder conviction rate. However, police brutality and corruption have dogged his time in office. There are also allegations of statistical tampering. Lawyer Tom Goldberg has pointed out that the high conviction rate comes from the clearing of so called 'cold cases' after examination with new forensic evidence, 'Mayor Ochoa and the Liberty City PD are using statistics to blind the people as to the true nature of life on the streets of this city. It's dangerous - your children are not safe.' Last year over 10,000 illegal firearms were recovered by the LCPD. There were over 500 gun-related homicides. Is Ochoa's campaign a case of too little, too late? Will his jaunts to sunnier cities save our children from their almost certain fates? The sale or possession of firearms is illegal here, in Liberty City. Does that mean that weapons are only in the hands of people willing to use them for evil? It remains to be seen. ",
